//  The distance a vehicle traels can be calculated as follows:
//  distance = speed * time
//  For example, if a train travels 40 miles per hour for 4 hours, the distance traveled is
//  120 miles.
//  Write a program that asks the user for the speed of a vehicle (in miles per hour) and how
//  many hours it has traveled. The program should be able to then use a loop to display the distance the
//  vehicle has traveled for each hour of that time period. Here is an example of the output:
//
//  What is the speed of the vehicle in mph? 40
//  How many hours has it traveled? 3
//
//  Hour    Distance traveled
//  -------------------------
//  1               40
//  2               80
//  3               120
//
//  Input Validation: Do not accept a negative number for speed and do not accept any
//  value less than 1 for time traveled.
